/*
Creating a single scripted procedure to encompass the complexities of the current digital economy-system, 
Bitcoin, and its interactions with conditions, recursive functions, geocoordination, 
and metarules is a substantial task. However, I can provide you with a high-level outline 
and a simplified representation of how such a procedure might look conceptually. 
Please note that this is a simplified conceptual representation, 
and implementing a real-world system would require much more detailed and specific code.

//BOF

// Define a function to represent the Bitcoin system
function BitcoinSystem(userIdentity, scopedEntropy, timeOfDay) {
  // Conditions related to Satoshi and Bitcoin
  const conditions = {
    Satoshi: {
      identity: userIdentity,
      scopedEntropy: scopedEntropy,
      timeOfDay: timeOfDay,
    },
    Bitcoin: {
      recursiveFunctions: [],
      indexedState: [],
    },
  };

  // Geocoordination as indexed scales of interactions
  const geocoordination = {
    latitude: 0.0,
    longitude: 0.0,
  };

  // Metarule for self-closed dynamic cycle
  function applyMetarule() {
    // Logic for applying the metarule
    // This metarule defines how conditions and Bitcoin interact dynamically
  }

  // Function to execute Bitcoin transactions
  function executeBitcoinTransaction(recipient, amount) {
    // Logic for executing Bitcoin transactions
  }

  // Function to request a datablock from the Bitcoin network
  function requestDatablock() {
    // Logic for requesting a promised datablock from Bitcoin
  }

  // Main execution logic
  function main() {
    // Perform operations related to conditions, recursive functions, and Bitcoin
    // Use geocoordination for interactions
    // Apply metarules for dynamic cycles
    // Execute Bitcoin transactions and request datablocks
  }

  // Start the Bitcoin system
  main();
}

// Example usage:
const userIdentity = 'User123';
const scopedEntropy = 'Scope456';
const timeOfDay = 'DayShift';
const bitcoinInstance = new BitcoinSystem(userIdentity, scopedEntropy, timeOfDay);

/* In this simplified conceptual script: 

We define a BitcoinSystem function that represents the Bitcoin system.
The conditions object includes information related to Satoshi and Bitcoin.
geocoordination represents the geocoordinates used for interactions.
applyMetarule defines how conditions and Bitcoin interact.
executeBitcoinTransaction and requestDatablock represent Bitcoin-specific actions.
The main function orchestrates the overall logic.
We create an instance of the Bitcoin system with example user identity, scoped entropy, and time of day.
Please note that this is a highly abstract and simplified representation. In a real-world implementation, 
each component would require extensive code and integration with the Bitcoin network, 
cryptographic operations, and more. Additionally, Bitcoin operates on a decentralized network, 
and interactions are not centralized as depicted here. */
