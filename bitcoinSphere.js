/*
Creating a single scripted procedure to encompass the complexities of the current digital economy-system, 
Bitcoin, and its interactions with conditions, recursive functions, geocoordination, 
and metarules is a substantial task. However, I can provide you with a high-level outline 
and a simplified representation of how such a procedure might look conceptually. 
Please note that this is a simplified conceptual representation, 
and implementing a real-world system would require much more detailed and specific code.
*/

// Define a function to represent the Bitcoin system
function BitcoinSystem(userIdentity, scopedEntropy, timeOfDay) {
  // Conditions related to Satoshi and Bitcoin
  const conditions = {
    Satoshi: {
      identity: userIdentity,
      scopedEntropy: scopedEntropy,
      timeOfDay: timeOfDay,
    },
    Bitcoin: {
      recursiveFunctions: [],
      indexedState: [],
    },
  };

  // Geocoordination as indexed scales of interactions
  const geocoordination = {
    latitude: 0.0,
    longitude: 0.0,
  };

  // Metarule for self-closed dynamic cycle
  function applyMetarule() {
    // Logic for applying the metarule
    // This metarule defines how conditions and Bitcoin interact dynamically
  }

  // Function to execute Bitcoin transactions
  function executeBitcoinTransaction(recipient, amount) {
    // Logic for executing Bitcoin transactions
  }

  // Function to request a datablock from the Bitcoin network
  function requestDatablock() {
    // Logic for requesting a promised datablock from Bitcoin
  }

  // Main execution logic
  function main() {
    // Perform operations related to conditions, recursive functions, and Bitcoin
    // Use geocoordination for interactions
    // Apply metarules for dynamic cycles
    // Execute Bitcoin transactions and request datablocks
  }

  // Start the Bitcoin system
  main();
}

// Example usage:
const userIdentity = 'User123';
const scopedEntropy = 'Scope456';
const timeOfDay = 'DayShift';
const bitcoinInstance = new BitcoinSystem(userIdentity, scopedEntropy, timeOfDay);
